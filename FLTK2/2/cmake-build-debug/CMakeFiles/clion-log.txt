CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/129/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (X11) does
  not match the name of the calling package (FLTK).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /snap/clion/129/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindX11.cmake:366 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  /snap/clion/129/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindFLTK.cmake:98 (include)
